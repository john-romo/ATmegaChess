All code was written and created by John Romo. Even if you 
wanted to sell it (which you don't) you can't.

This will eventually be a chess engine small and simple
enough to be run from an ATmega328P micro-controller.  So
far, I have finished with the rules of chess and am just 
starting to work on the engine.  Since school is super busy
right now (with lotsa math) this project will likely remain
unfinished for some time.  

The main function and the makefile are currently set up for
testing.  I will be posting a youtube video at some point
to explain the ins and outs of it all.
